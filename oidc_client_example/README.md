# OIDC Client Example
This container mocks a third party which uses the authentication with this eid authentication service.


## Start example client
* Run the client in the project root dir, via `docker-compose -f docker-compose.example.yml up`

Environment variables to be set in `.env`:

* `CLIENT_ID` id generated by the OpenID-Provider
* `REDIRECT_URL` uri that will be called after the authentication
* `AUTHORITY_URL` uri of the authentication service

## Generate a client id
You have to register your client in your openID provider, during this registration process a provider unique client id will be created. This is the id you can use as value for `CLIENT_ID`.

## Set Urls
The redirect url is the url which will be used if the authorization process was successfull. You have to set a set of possible redirect urls during the registration process mentioned above. Therefore the redirect url used in the variable has to be an element of the former defined set. In our case a valid value could be `http://localhost:3000`.

The authority url is the url to the open id provider server, that will be used to authenticate. In our case a valid value could be something like `https://eid.localhost/api/openid`.
