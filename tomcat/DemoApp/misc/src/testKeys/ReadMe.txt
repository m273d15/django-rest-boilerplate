In this directory, you find keys and certificates matching the 
Governikus Autent test configuration. These files are exclusively
for testing, do not use any of these keys for productive 
applications!   
 
PIN for all key stores and keys in this directory is "123456"

Clients implementing SSL with client authentication should use 
one of the *_ssl.jks keystores which contain only one key pair. 
The file serviceProvider_ssl.jks contains these 3 certificates 
too and is for the server side trust store.
